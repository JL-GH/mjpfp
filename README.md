# Mini Junior Phase Final Project 4 Real
**A project to let you creatively flex your JS muscles and put the whole stack together.**

## Goal
**You're going to build a calendar!**

Its important that you use each and every piece of our tech stack up to this point. By that I mean:
- React
- Redux
- Express
- Sequelize (honestly, optional if you want to write raw SQL, all to you!)
- Postgres
- Webpack/Babel (to the extent your front end should be able to be made with ESM syntax)
- Node

## Instructions
1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Build your project in your fork of this repo!
4. Voila!

## Required Features
1. CRUD Stuff
  - You can **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete events from the calendar. By this, we mean that there is a front-end application where we enter information and request changes to that information, and a server dealing with processing those requests and storing them in a database.
  - There are forms for creation, pages to read the data from, buttons and/or forms to update data, and buttons to delete data.
2. Style
  - Employers like pretty web pages! This is an opportunity for you to show off your CSS/HTML/UX skills.
3. Tests
  - Yes, we'd like to see a few tests. We are not going to be specific here so that you can test what you think is valuable.
4. Using our Stack
  - You should use our stack appropriately.
    - State should be in Redux.
    - HTML should be written in React.
    - Express should handle server requests.
    - Your data should be stored in Postgres.
  - We ask that you not use any boiler plate or directly copy code. It is obviously ok to look over older code and videos!

## Extra Features
1. Marking events/tasks ‚úÖ or ‚õîÔ∏è
2. Notifications of some sort! Look into email, and/or something like sockets
3. Deploying your site
4. Add guests to events - be able to click on a guest to see their calendar üëª
5. Mobile responsive!
6. Drag and Drop!

[This is a link to a demo of one I made with no backend (with some and definitely not all the extra features)! So that you can better understand visually what we are looking for!](http://donut-calendar.surge.sh/)

**I want to be very clear that your site does not, and probably should not look like this one! The code is obfuscated and not-copyable, and there is purposefully not a backend so it wouldn't pass the specs anyway. Use this as an opportunity to build something from scratch on your own!**
